This pluging automatically adds Meta tags to the head of the website and adds the necessary OG tags for Social Media. Meta title is generated from the post/page title OR the Custom Field cejay-title, with the latter taking precedence. The meta description is generated from WordPress's automatic excerpt, a custom excerpt or the custom field cejay-description, with the latter taking precedence. Meta keywords are not generated as they are not considered by search engines and some search engines consider them spammy. The featured image is used to create the OG images tags. OG type is always "website". The OG for URL, locale and site name are all retrieved from your WordPress setup and the appropriate Meta is put in the head of the website.
